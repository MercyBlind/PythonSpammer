# Error's
If the cmd prompt close's immediately after opening, open the folder in pycharm, atom or any IDE that support python *legit pick one there are hundreds* and open the terminal in your IDE of choice and type the following, **pip install pyautogui** wait for it to install then once done type **pip install os** <-- THIS SHOULD BE INSTALLED ALREADY, but there have been cases it's not.
